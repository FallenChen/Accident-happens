1. address pf #touch1# is #00000000004017c0#
2. disassemble #getbuf#
   ```asm
    4017a8:	48 83 ec 28          	sub    $0x28,%rsp
    4017ac:	48 89 e7             	mov    %rsp,%rdi
    4017af:	e8 8c 02 00 00       	callq  401a40 <Gets>
   ```
3. 0x28 = 40, so we need to input 40 bytes to overflow the buffer and overwrite the return address of #getbuf# to #touch1#, i.e. #00000000004017c0#

a 64-bit system, the return address is 8 bytes long. If you only use 7 bytes, the last byte of the return address will remain unmodified, resulting in an incorrect address being used when the program attempts to return. This could cause unexpected behavior or a crash.
